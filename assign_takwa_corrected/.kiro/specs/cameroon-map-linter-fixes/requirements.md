# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the TypeScript and React linting errors in the CameroonMapView.tsx component. The component currently has 25 linting errors and 2 warnings that need to be resolved to maintain code quality and type safety. The fixes will improve code maintainability, type safety, and adherence to React best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CameroonMapView component to pass all TypeScript linting rules, so that the codebase maintains type safety and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the linter runs on CameroonMapView.tsx THEN there SHALL be zero `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` errors
2. WHEN TypeScript types are used THEN they SHALL be properly defined interfaces or types instead of `any`
3. WHEN Highcharts types are referenced THEN they SHALL use proper Highcharts type definitions
4. WHEN chart options and data are defined THEN they SHALL have specific TypeScript interfaces

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused variables to be removed from the component, so that the code is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the linter runs THEN there SHALL be zero `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` errors
2. WHEN variables are declared but not used THEN they SHALL be removed or prefixed with underscore
3. WHEN function parameters are not used THEN they SHALL be handled appropriately
4. WHEN loop variables are not used THEN they SHALL be replaced with underscore

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React hooks to have proper dependency arrays, so that the component behaves predictably and avoids infinite re-renders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useEffect hooks are used THEN they SHALL have complete and accurate dependency arrays
2. WHEN useMemo hooks are used THEN they SHALL include all referenced dependencies
3. WHEN callback functions are used in dependencies THEN they SHALL be properly memoized
4. WHEN the linter runs THEN there SHALL be zero `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures, so that the code is type-safe and self-documenting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chart data is processed THEN it SHALL use properly typed interfaces
2. WHEN Highcharts options are defined THEN they SHALL use Highcharts type definitions
3. WHEN event handlers are defined THEN they SHALL have proper event type annotations
4. WHEN API responses are handled THEN they SHALL have defined response types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the component to maintain all existing functionality while fixing linting issues, so that no features are broken during the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linting fixes are applied THEN all map visualization features SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN types are added THEN the component SHALL render correctly in all view modes
3. WHEN unused variables are removed THEN no functionality SHALL be lost
4. WHEN dependency arrays are fixed THEN the component SHALL not have performance regressions
